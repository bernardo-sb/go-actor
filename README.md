# Asynchronous Programming and the Actor Model in Golang

This repo supports the blog post: [Asynchronous Programming and the Actor Model in Golang](http://bernardo.shippedbrain.com/go_lang_async_actors/)

In the world of concurrent and parallel programming, asynchronous programming and the actor model stand out as powerful paradigms. Golang, with its built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels, provides an excellent and intuitive environment for implementing these concepts. In this blog post, weâ€™ll explore asynchronous programming and the actor model in Golang using a sample program.

Understanding the Actor Model

The actor model is a computer science and mathematical model for concurrent computation. It defines a set of rules for actors, which are independent entities that communicate by sending messages to each other. Each actor has its own state, and the only way to interact with an actor is by sending it a message. Actors operate independently and can create new actors or decide how to handle incoming messages.
